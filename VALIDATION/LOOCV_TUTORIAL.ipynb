Although simple to use and no configuration to specify, there are times when the procedure should not be used, such as when you have a very large dataset or a computationally expensive model to evaluate.\n","\n","* Cross-validation, or k-fold cross-validation, is a procedure used to estimate the performance of a machine learning algorithm when making predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n","\n","* The cross-validation has a single hyperparameter “k” that controls the number of subsets that a dataset is split into. Once split, each subset is given the opportunity to be used as a test set while all other subsets together are used as a training dataset.\n","\n","* This means that k-fold cross-validation involves fitting and evaluating k models. This, in turn, provides k estimates of a model’s performance on the dataset, which can be reported using summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation. This score can then be used to compare and ultimately select a model and configuration to use as the “final model” for a dataset.\n","\n","* Typical values for k are k=3, k=5, and k=10, with 10 representing the most common value. This is because, given extensive testing, 10-fold cross-validation provides a good balance of low computational cost and low bias in the estimate of model performance as compared to other k values and a single train-test split.\n","\n","* Leave-one-out cross-validation, or LOOCV, is a configuration of k-fold cross-validation where k is set to the number of examples in the dataset.\n","\n","* LOOCV is an extreme version of k-fold cross-validation that has the maximum computational cost. It requires one model to be created and evaluated for each example in the training dataset.\n","\n","* The benefit of so many fit and evaluated models is a more robust estimate of model performance as each row of data is given an opportunity to represent the entirety of the test dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"qYnHsloK8b0X"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from numpy import mean\n","from numpy import std\n","from numpy import absolute\n","from pandas import read_csv\n","\n","from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneOut\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor"],"metadata":{"id":"8-Juk8sXUhT3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Basic example"],"metadata":{"id":"F2vALfdw9kOY"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XGyQgbnH8Qt3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653394050781,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":31614,"user":{"displayName":"Niyaz Ismail Jalal","userId":"07973030520808053987"}},"outputId":"f0d7928e-057d-460b-f59a-6b4284f7bec4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy: 0.990\n"]}],"source":["# create dataset\n","X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, random_state=1)\n","\n","# create loocv procedure\n","cv = LeaveOneOut()\n","\n","# enumerate splits\n","y_true, y_pred = list(), list()\n","for train_ix, test_ix in cv.split(X):\n","\n","\t# split data\n","\tX_train, X_test = X[train_ix, :], X[test_ix, :]\n","\ty_train, y_test = y[train_ix], y[test_ix]\n","\n","\t# fit model\n","\tmodel = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1)\n","\tmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n"," \n","\t# evaluate model\n","\tyhat = model.predict(X_test)\n"," \n","\t# store\n","\ty_true.append(y_test[0])\n","\ty_pred.append(yhat[0])\n"," \n","# calculate accuracy\n","acc = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)\n","print('Accuracy: %.3f' % acc)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Given that the dataset has 100 examples, it means that 100 train/test splits of the dataset were created, with each single row of the dataset given an opportunity to be used as the test set.
